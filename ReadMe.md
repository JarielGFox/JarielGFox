# Giovanni Crudele - Junior Web Developer

- 👋 Hi, I'm Giovanni, also known online as Jariel, hailing from Italy.
- 👀 I have a keen interest in coding, technology, IT and science.
- 🌱 I'm constantly broadening my knowledge base, which is rooted in web technologies such as CSS 3.0, JavaScript ES6, PHP 8.x, and MySQL.
- ✨ Recently, I've learnt the Laravel back-end framework and the Vue.js front-end framework. I'm currently learning new technologies like React and TypeScript to enhance my web development skills.
- 💞️ I'm working on several small projects, which you can check out in my public repositories.
